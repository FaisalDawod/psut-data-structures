# Doubly-Linked Lists Study Guide

We advise you to study in the following order:

1. Make sure that you can write and analyze the code for the [DLList](../code/dll_comments.h) and [OrderedList](../code/ordered_list.h) classes.

2. Practice using [Exercises 8-14](../exercises/list_exercises.md).

3. Practice using the following recent previous exams:

    * Second Exam Fall 2022 - Question 2 ([solution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1caBxJHxHRAk1k-fz-fDn51XMe-ds1Cg0/view?usp=share_link))

    * Second Exam Spring 2022 - Question 1 ([solution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B2wwtuXLiJjhmAHoVMnpWm2kEAx9GpOF/view?usp=share_link))

    * [Midterm Exam - Fall 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dAMSwZIaUHxgv95D3pNuzg9Qh0bcr_UY/view?usp=share_link) - Question 3.C ([solution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJMzZyC2iNYfi3XsEUYSThoFLZ-pvitw/view?usp=share_link))

4. Practice using [old previous exams](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15BVMhjwFnGattwKcs6xEZKDmKR7CzMbF-gSj-buPzY4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110789104378877559009).

**Note**. Make sure to practice by writing _full_ programs (on paper or on the IDE). Compare your solution to the reference solution and understand the differences and how they affect the solution. Only reading reference solutions and understanding them without writing code yourself does not prepare you adequately.
