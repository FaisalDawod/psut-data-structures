# Stacks and Queues Study Guide

We advise you to study in the following order:

1. Make sure that you understand the slides and can write and analyze the code in the following files: [stack_dll.h](../code/stack_dll.h), [stack_array.h](../code/stack_array.h), [queue_dll.h](../code/queue_dll.h), [queue_array.h](../code/queue_array.h), [stack_queue.cpp](stack_queue.cpp).

2. Practice using the [Exercises](../exercises/stacks_queues_exercises.md).

3. Practice using the following recent previous exams:

    * Second Exam Fall 2022 - Question 1 ([solution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1caBxJHxHRAk1k-fz-fDn51XMe-ds1Cg0/view?usp=share_link))

    * Second Exam Spring 2022 - Question 2 ([solution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B2wwtuXLiJjhmAHoVMnpWm2kEAx9GpOF/view?usp=share_link))

    * [Midterm Exam - Fall 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dAMSwZIaUHxgv95D3pNuzg9Qh0bcr_UY/view?usp=share_link) - Question 2 ([solution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJMzZyC2iNYfi3XsEUYSThoFLZ-pvitw/view?usp=share_link))

    * [Final Exam - Fall 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tjQJ4rxh3BNF0yc0lvceFv3DuwS_XAdX/view?usp=share_link) - Question 5
    
    * [Final Exam - Spring 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fDMaAQVWAao2sVxTA-YpLZpCRLkpmlyK/view?usp=share_link) - Question 5

4. Practice using old previous exams. You can find questions on stacks and queues in previous second and final exams.

**Note**. Make sure to practice by writing _full_ programs (on paper or on the IDE). Compare your solution to the reference solution and understand the differences and how they affect the solution. Only reading reference solutions and understanding them without writing code yourself does not prepare you adequately.
