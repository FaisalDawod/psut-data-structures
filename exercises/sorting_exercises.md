# Searching & Sorting Exercises

## Basic Tracing

Fill out the following table with the exact number of operations (swaps/shifts/data compares).
Assume the algorithm implementations covered in class where:
* Bubble Sort uses a "swapped" flag to stop when the array gets sorted.
* Selection Sort does not swap an element with itself.

|                |SELECTION SORT                 |INSERTION SORT               |BUBBLE SORT 
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------
|`1 2 3 4 5`     | Swaps =                       | Shifts =                    | Swaps =  
|                | Data compares =               | Data compares =             | Data compares = 
|`5 4 3 2 1`     | Swaps =                       | Shifts =                    | Swaps = 
|                | Data compares =               | Data compares =             | Data compares = 
|`5 1 2 3 4`     | Swaps =                       | Shifts =                    | Swaps = 
|                | Data compares =               | Data compares =             | Data compares = 
|`1 5 4 3 2`     | Swaps =                       | Shifts =                    | Swaps = 
|                | Data compares =               | Data compares =             | Data compares =
